# python_Ex
This dir is all about how to write your python code as a beginner. i have used some of the basics topics of python. I try to bash around the basics,
from how to create a list in python to how to use dictionary and loop through the dictionary, in addition to how one can use conditional statements in a loop.
I also tried to make my codes looks cleans and descriptive, considering the readability of the code is standard. 
### As this repo is beginner friendly, i keep on updating this repo as i get along in my python learning curve. The repo range from naive learning to a nuance python coder.
